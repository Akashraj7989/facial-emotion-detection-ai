# Facial Emotion Detection — Fixed package for Python 3.12

This archive contains your original project with fixes to make it run under **Python 3.12** in VS Code.

What I changed:
- Replaced `requirements.txt` with a Python 3.12–compatible set of package versions.
- Added helper scripts:
  - `run_3.12.bat` — creates/activates venv using Python 3.12, installs requirements, runs `app.py`.
  - `run_3.12.ps1` — same for PowerShell (may need ExecutionPolicy adjustment).
- Added `.vscode/settings.json` to prefer `py -3.12` interpreter.
- Backed up original `requirements.txt` as `requirements.txt.backup` if it existed.

How to run (Windows):
1. Open PowerShell (recommended) or Command Prompt.
2. `cd` into project folder.
3. For PowerShell (may need to allow scripts temporarily):
   - `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
   - `.un_3.12.ps1`
4. Or in CMD:
   - `run_3.12.bat`

Notes:
- Ensure Python 3.12 is installed and `py -3.12` works (run `py -0p` to list installed Pythons).
- If you prefer using Python 3.13, you may encounter build issues for some packages.
- After a successful install, open the folder in VS Code and select the interpreter `py -3.12`.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Run static checks/fixes on `app.py` (I can attempt to auto-fix obvious import or path issues).
- Create a simplified `app_fixed.py` that uses FER only or provides a simple Flask UI.
